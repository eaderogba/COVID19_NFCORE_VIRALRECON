# SARS-CoV-2 WGS Analysis with nf-core/viralrecon
This repository contains the workflow for the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of SARS-CoV-2 using the `nf-core/viralrecon` pipeline. The analysis is based on a benchmark dataset, which includes 16 samples from CDC-defined Variants of Interest/Variants of Concern (VOI/VOC) lineages.

## Dataset Description
The dataset is a validated lineage-calling benchmark set, designed for the study of VOI/VOC lineages of SARS-CoV-2. Detailed information about the dataset can be found here.

## Reference Sequence
The analysis utilizes the Wuhan-1 reference sequence (`MN908947.fa`) for mapping the sequence data.

## Running the Analysis
To run the analysis with `nf-core/viralrecon`, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed and follow the instructions provided in the `nf-core/viralrecon` documentation.
